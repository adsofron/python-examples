This is a repository that contains a few python code examples. Some of the exercises were done following Python course from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) and others by following "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" from [Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)
